Canyon VPN creates a virtual LAN network between you and your friends that works as if you were connected physically. You can play games, send files, securely chat with your friends, and more.

Features
-----
####Zero configuration
Forget about port forwarding, static IPs, NATs or firewalls. Canyon does all the hard work for you.

####Easy to use
Your friends are tied to your account so you won't have to configure your network every time you reinstall Canyon or are using a different device.

####Compatible
Canyon works across a wide range of hardware and software, out of the box.

####High performance
Canyon adds virtually no overhead to your network, compared to a physical LAN. And because it is so lightweight it won't hog your CPU either.

####Secure
Canyon was developed from the ground up with security in mind. Your data packets are encrypted between your peers and our servers.

####Designed for gaming
With Canyon you can play most LAN-compatible games, including Minecraft, with no added lag.
